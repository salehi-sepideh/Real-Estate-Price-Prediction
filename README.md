README for Tehran Housing Price Prediction Project
Project Overview
  In this project, I analyzed and predicted housing prices in Tehran using various features. Initially, I visualized the data to explore how different features impact house prices.

Steps Taken

  Data Exploration & Visualization:

    Examined housing prices based on various features to identify key influencing factors.

  Data Preprocessing:

    Performed necessary data cleaning and feature engineering to improve model performance.

  Model Selection & Training:

    Tested multiple machine learning algorithms for regression.

    The best performance was achieved using RandomForestRegressor.

  Hyperparameter Optimization:

    Used GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.

    Achieved 85% R² accuracy on training data and 84% R² accuracy on test data.
    
Results
The optimized RandomForestRegressor model successfully predicts housing prices in Tehran with high accuracy.
